# NBFvis
A R package for Neighborhood-Based Featurization visualizaion by Tinghui Xu and Kris Sankaran.

## Introduction
Dimensionality reduction of spatial omic data can reveal shared, spatially structured patterns of expression across a collection of genomic features. We study strategies for discovering and interactively visualizing low-dimensional structure in spatial omic data based on the construction of neighborhood features. We design quantile and network-based spatial features that result in spatially consistent embeddings. A simulation compares embeddings made with and without neighborhood-based featurization, and a re-analysis of [Keren et al., 2019] illustrates the overall workflow. We provide an R package, NBFvis, to support computation and interactive visualization for the proposed dimensionality reduction approach.
